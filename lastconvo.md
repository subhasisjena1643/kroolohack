I'm building a real-time classroom engagement analyzer for a hackathon. I need to create an AI pipeline that processes laptop camera feed and microphone input to detect:

1. Face detection and counting (attendance) using YOLOv8
2. Head pose estimation to detect attention direction
3. Hand gesture recognition for participation tracking
4. Audio processing for speaker diarization and sentiment
5. Real-time engagement scoring algorithm

The system must:
- Process video at 30fps with <5s latency
- Run on laptop hardware (no GPU required)
- Output JSON data to Node.js backend via API/WebSocket
- Be privacy-compliant (no face ID storage)

Please help me set up the Python environment, install required packages, and create the core AI processing pipeline with modular architecture.

Working on hackathon project: Real-time classroom engagement analyzer
Tech stack: Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, MediaPipe, audio processing libraries
Role: AI/ML pipeline developer
Teammate: Sachin (full-stack developer)
Deadline: MVP by 2am tonight
Focus: Computer vision, audio analysis, real-time processing

# Your main components to build:
1. Face Detection & Tracking
2. Pose Estimation 
3. Gesture Recognition
4. Audio Analysis
5. Engagement Scoring Algorithm
